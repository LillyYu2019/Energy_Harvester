2019_11 and 2019 _12
old data, no sucessful sensor or dynamic data taken

2019_01_13
-first succsessful sensor and dynamic data taken 
-with Nema17 no gear box

2019_01_15
-second succsessful sensor and dynamic data taken 
-with Nema17 no gear box
-data used for paper

2020-02-12
-new interupt routine, new encoder, new 100:1 gear ratio NEMA17 with big gear, works
-a and a_SS is for steady state data only
-b is for transient at 2 and 2.8 A
-c is for backlash at 2.8A +5 and -5 deg

2020-02-21
new load controlled through arduino, smaller stepper motor gear teeth, tighter shield
-a: 39.9Hz, steady state and dynamic at 27GPM
-b: 39.0HZ, steady state and dynamic at 26GPM
-c: 38.0Hz, steady state and dynamic at 25GPM
